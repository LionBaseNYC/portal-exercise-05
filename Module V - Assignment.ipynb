    "EnviroBox is a company in North Africa that has developed a modular and affordable greenhouse for farmers hit hard by climate change. Their business model works as follows:\n",
    "- Provide loans to farmers to finance the greenhouse\n",
    "- The farmer eventually pays back EnviroBox with interest through the crop earnings\n",

    "If an individual receives a loan and ends being unable to pay it back, EnviroBox loses \\$5,000 on average.\n",

    "- balance (amount of money they currently have)\n",
